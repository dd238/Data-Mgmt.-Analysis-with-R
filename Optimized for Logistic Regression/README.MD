This program will construct a dataframe that combines several sources of data to produce a table in which logistic regression can be applied. The purpose of this program is to demonstrate how to merge columns of data from CSV files. This program will demonstrate this through the use of "lapply" and "rbind", two simple and powerful functions. This program demonstrates how to interatively replace specific values in a dataframe with the value of NA.
