The goal of this project was to predict the average rating of a TV show based off information about that TV show including but not limited to average rating, number of votes, episode length, season number, and script word count.

For this project I used R Studio in conjuction with the libraries: "rvest" and "tidyverse" .

Due to file upload restrictions I will provide links in place of the script data. Simply run the R code above the line "Code above gets episode names" in the "DD_project.R" file. Depending on your designated destination this will generate the script files needed from the respective websites. Input that file path for the line "setwd("your file path here")" which is below the line "Code above gets episode names".
